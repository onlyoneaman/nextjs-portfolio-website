# Laws of UX

A list of rules that UX designers should consider when designing user interfaces.

## Heuristics
A heuristic is a simple, experience-based rule used to make decisions or solve problems quickly. In UX, it’s often applied to evaluate the usability of interfaces.

### Aesthetic-Usability Effect
Users often perceive aesthetically pleasing design as design that’s more usable.

### Fitts’s Law
The time to acquire a target is a function of the distance to and size of the target.

### Goal Gradient Effect
People are more motivated to complete a task the closer they are to finishing it.

### Hick’s Law
The time it takes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices.

### Jakob’s Law
Users spend most of their time on other sites. This means that users prefer your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know.

### Miller’s Law
The average person can only keep 7 (plus or minus 2) items in their working memory.

### Paradox  of the Active User
The more users engage with a site, the more they’ll be inclined to visit it again in the future.

### Parkinson’s Law
Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.

## Principles
Principles are high-level ideas that are used to inform the design of user interfaces.

### Doherty Threshold
Productivity soars when a computer and its users interact at a pace (<400ms) that ensures that neither has to wait on the other.

### Occam’s Razor
Among competing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected.

### Pareto Principle
Roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes.

### Postel’s Law
Be liberal in what you accept, and conservative in what you send.

### Tesler’s Law
There is a certain amount of complexity which cannot be reduced.

## Gestalt
Gestalt principles explain how humans perceive the world around them.

### Law of Common Region
Elements tend to be perceived into groups if they are sharing an area with a clearly defined boundary.

### Law of Proximity
Objects that are near, or proximate to each other, tend to be grouped together.

### Law of Prägnanz
People will perceive and interpret ambiguous or complex images as the simplest form possible.

### Law of Similarity
The human eye tends to build a relationship between similar elements in a design.

### Law of Uniform Connectedness
Elements that are visually connected are perceived as more related than elements with no connection.

## Cognitive Bias
Cognitive biases are systematic patterns of deviation from norm or rationality in judgment.

### Peak-End Rule
People judge an experience largely based on how they felt at its peak (i.e., its most intense point) and at its end, rather than based on the total sum or average of every moment of the experience.

### Serial Position Effect
Users have a propensity to best remember the first and last items in a series.

### Von Restorff Effect
The Von Restorff effect predicts that when multiple similar objects are present, the one that differs from the rest is most likely to be remembered.

### Zeigarnik Effect
People remember uncompleted or interrupted tasks better than completed tasks.

  - Matt Webb attempts to map out the different user experience approaches to building on top of generative AI. I like the way he categorizes these potential experiences:
    - Tools - Users control AI to generate something. 
    - Copilots - The AI works alongside the user in an app in multiple ways. 
    - Agents - The AI has some autonomy over how it approaches a task. 
    - Chat - The user talks to the AI as a peer in real-time.

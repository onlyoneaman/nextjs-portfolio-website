Added Animations to the website using [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/). It's a really cool library that makes it easy to add animations to your website. 

Maybe I can create a simple project #[[cool designs]] which consists of a few pages with different animations to showcase the capabilities of Framer Motion.

Added Animations to the website using [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/). It's a really cool library that makes it easy to add animations to your website. 

Maybe I can create a simple project #[[cool designs]] which consists of a few pages with different animations to showcase the capabilities of Framer Motion.

- WTF Nikhil Kamath Episodes are really nice. I should watch them more often. #[[wtf-nikhil-kamath]]
- Liked particularly ones about #[[Entrepreneurship]], #[[Venture Capital]], and #[[EV]]s.

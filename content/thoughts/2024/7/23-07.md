"I believe the Llama 3.1 release will be an inflection point in the industry where most developers begin to primarily use open source, and I expect that approach to only grow from here."
— Mark Zuckerberg

- #[[Meta AI]] launched #Llama3.1, most capable OS model to date. 
- #[[Meta AI]] are calling Llama 3.1 405B "the first frontier-level open source AI model" and it really is benchmarking in that GPT-4+ class, competitive with both GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet.
- It supports a 128K Token Context
- We’ve also updated our license to allow developers to use the outputs from Llama models — including 405B — to improve other models for the first time.
- We’re excited about how this will enable new advancements in the field through synthetic data generation and model distillation workflows, capabilities that have never been achieved at this scale in open source.
